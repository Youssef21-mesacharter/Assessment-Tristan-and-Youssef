# 📊 A Project on Plotting and Graphing

This is my end-of-unit project where i talk about what i learned during this unit.
# my Chart Below

Below is a table that follows the graph above:

| X | Y |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |

From the table above, we can see that

- The **Y-intercept** is 1
- **The slope is 1/1 which simplifies to 1**
- ``y=1x+1``
